Understanding the vulnerabilities of your WiFi network can be challenging as users can easily create networks on demand, or even perhaps unintentionally. But as recent events have demonstrated, scanning your WiFi network is an important part of understanding your security posture.

Most vulnerability assessment tools simply take their current network scanners and point them at the wireless infrastructure. This approach does not give you the information that is unique to wireless networks. Immunity has built the first automated, WiFi specific, vulnerability assessment and penetration tool.
