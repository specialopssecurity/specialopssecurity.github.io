Immunity's CANVAS makes available hundreds of exploits, an automated exploitation system, and a comprehensive, reliable exploit development framework to penetration testers and security professionals worldwide. A single installation license includes one year of our standard monthly updates and support, has no target IP address limitations, and includes full source code.

CANVAS' completely open design allows a team to adapt CANVAS to their environment and needs. CANVAS is supported on Windows (requires Python & PyGTK), Linux, and all other Python environments such as mobile phones and commercial Unixes (command line version only supported, GUI may also be available).

Understanding the vulnerabilities of your WiFi network can be challenging as users can easily create networks on demand, or even perhaps unintentionally. But as recent events have demonstrated, scanning your WiFi network is an important part of understanding your security posture.

Most vulnerability assessment tools simply take their current network scanners and point them at the wireless infrastructure. This approach does not give you the information that is unique to wireless networks. Immunity has built the first automated, WiFi specific, vulnerability assessment and penetration tool.
