After the 2020 pandemic, it seemed silly to continue paying rent on our beautiful [Newport Beach office](/assets/img/newport.jpg) so we've gone virtual. Our assessment team is located within the continental United States and has worked on previous engagements across five continents and 27 countries.

## 🎨 Graphics

Our graphic designer wanted you to know that our [corporate logo](/assets/img/SpecialOpsSecurity.png) is available as a high-resolution [Encapsulated PostScript](/assets/img/logo.eps) and is comprised of bespoke stylized lettering in Pantone PMS 5763 Green and PMS 452 Tan, with the word "Security" in pure white set in Linotype _Bank Gothic&reg; Medium_.
